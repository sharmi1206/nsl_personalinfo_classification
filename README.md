# nsl_personalinfo_classification
Neural Structured Learning (Adversarial) with TensorFlow

Dataset collected from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult (salary >50K, <=50K.)

neural_structured_learning_personal_info  shows training classification model with Adversarial Regularization

without_nsl_learning_personal_info.py. shows training classification model without Adversarial Regularization

The results folder contains summary from each one of them and depicts how Training with Adversarial Regularization can 
increase the model aaccuracy and its robustness.
